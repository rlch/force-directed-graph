Implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm in Dart, to draw force-directed graphs through Flutter.

# Note:

Please use my [d3-force-flutter](https://github.com/MathGaps/d3-force-flutter) repo which uses Verlet integration instead. The experience is indentical to that of [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)
